# Hyperaudio Community Contributing Guide

This guide is intended as a straightforward document to explain and encourage community contributions to the Hyperaudio codebase, direction, documentation and any other content.

We hope to this document will:

* Encourage contributions
* Encourage contributors to stay involved
* Create a transparent and open decision making process

# Finding your way around

There are quite a few repositories in the Hyperaudio GitHub account. The main ones are pinned. Broadly speaking Hyperaudio can be split into the service (hosted at hyperaud.io) and the Hyperaudio Lite library.

The service is made up of a number of components [see the Wiki](https://github.com/hyperaudio/README/wiki).

There are other repos - many of them experimental - we do a lot of experimenting. However we welcome contributions to all. All our code is MIT licensed.

We're also in the process of designing a new version of the Hyperaudio Service, so you may see new repositories appearing soon. These will be clearly labelled and we're super happy to have contibutors to those too! :heart_eyes:

Some repos may have their own contributing.md these are intended to be compatible with document.
