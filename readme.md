The Hyperaudio GitHub organisation contains a series of open source repositories that can be used to build thigs that make media easy to navigate, share and remix audiovisual media.

It contains all the code we use to make the [Hyperaud.io](https://hyperaud.io)
) Web Application - a working prototype. Additionally it is home to standalone libraries such as [Hyperaudio-Lite](https://github.com/hyperaudio/hyperaudio-lite) - an Interactive Transcript viewer.

All public code is this repo is [MIT Licensed](https://github.com/hyperaudio/README/blob/master/MIT-licence.md)

- [Hyperaudio Pad](https://github.com/hyperaudio/hyperaudio-pad)
- [Hyperaudio Converter](https://github.com/hyperaudio/ha-converter)
- [Hyperaudio Maker](https://github.com/hyperaudio/ha-cleaner)
- [Hyperaudio Cleaner](https://github.com/hyperaudio/ha-maker)

Everything the Hyperaudio Team create is open source, most code resides under the Hyperaudio GitHub account, although some of code for tools can be found under the organisations with whom we have developed them in collaboration.
